    <p>This Kanji meaning <span class="kanji-span shadow">memorize</span> is made up of the Radicals <span class="radical-span shadow">viking</span> and <span class="radical-span shadow">see</span>. Imagine a <span class="radical-span shadow">viking</span> having to naviagte his ship through oceans.
      Being granted his ability to <span class="radical-span shadow">see</span> he is able to recognize areas he once <span class="kanji-span shadow">memorize</span>d.

        <p>This radical means to <span class="larger-radical-span shadow">see</span>. There's an <span class="radical-span shadow">eye</span>ball on top of some <span class="radical-span shadow">legs</span>. When your <span class="radical-span shadow">eyes</span> get taken places (on <span class="radical-span shadow">legs</span>, in this case),
          your <span class="radical-span shadow">eyes</span> are seeing those things. Think about the Lord of Rings.
          The <span class="radical-span shadow">Eye</span> of Mordor pretty much stands on something like <span class="radical-span shadow">legs</span> and <span class="larger-radical-span shadow">sees</span> everything, well almost everything.
